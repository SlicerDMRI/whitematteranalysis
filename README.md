# Synopsis
White Matter Analysis provides clustering and tractography analysis tools.

It implements algorithms from publications listed here:

# Installation
## 1. Install Python 2. 
Anaconda is a nice option since it has VTK and scipy, and includes up-to-date pip and setuptools.

  - Download and install Miniconda (**Python 2**) from https://conda.io/miniconda.html
  
  - Activate the conda environment (if applicable):
      
      - Windows:
      
      > \> /path/to/anaconda/Scripts/activate.bat
      
      - macOS and Linux:
      
      > $ /path/to/anaconda/bin/conda activate

### 1a. (Windows-only): install VTK 6.3 from [C. Gohlke's windows packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#vtk) (PyPI VTK packages for Windows are only available for Python 3):

      pip install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/o4uhg4xd/VTK-6.3.0-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
   
## 2. Install whitematteranalysis with pip: 

      pip install git+https://github.com/SlicerDMRI/whitematteranalysis.git
      


Note: If you decide to use another python that does not already have VTK, you can compile VTK.
* VTK: http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Building
* http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Git/Download

You will need to compile it with python wrapping. VTK_WRAP_PYTHON must be on.
Make sure that at configure time it finds the version of python that you want to use for this project. You may need to toggle t for advanced mode in ccmake. I have something like this when I run:
     cd VTK-build
     ccmake ../VTK

       PYTHON_EXECUTABLE                /Users/lauren/anaconda/bin/python            
       PYTHON_EXTRA_LIBS                                                             
       PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR               /Users/lauren/anaconda/pkgs/python-2.7.4-1/in
       PYTHON_LIBRARY                   /Users/lauren/anaconda/lib/libpython2.7.dylib
       PYTHON_UTIL_LIBRARY              /usr/lib/libutil.dylib   

Note this requires both git and cmake. More information is at vtk.org.
To install your compiled vtk into your python:
     cd VTK-build/Wrapping/Python
     python setup.py install
